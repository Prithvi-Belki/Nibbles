   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Bread-Omelette</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Brown Bread</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Chilli</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the egg in a bowl till the mix turns frothy</li>
        <li>Add the veggies, green chillies, followed by the desired seasoning, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add your oil to a flat cooking pan, and let it heat.</li>
        <li>Drop the egg mixture onto the heated pan, spread it uniformly and let it cook for 2 minutes on medium flame. Flip the omelette once the sides start browning and the surface looks half cooked. Lift the omelette up from the flat pan.</li>
        <li>Place one slice of bread on the same pan to toast it. Meanwhile, place the omelette on top of the bread and fold it in a square shape. You may alternatively first place the cheese slice/grated cheese in the middle before folding it in. Allow the cheese to melt.</li>
        <li>Place the other bread slice on top and then flip it so that the other bread slice gets toasted.</li>
        <li>Once the surface crisps up, take it off heat.</li>
        <li>Slice the sandwich into half and serve warm.
        </li>
